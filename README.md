# A/B testing in Go sample

[Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a demo website built with the Go programming language. In the article, it was used in a demo A/B test experiment where each variation of the home page was released to a user segment to gather metrics. In the end, we compared metrics to determine which variation performed best.
